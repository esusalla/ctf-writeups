- provided with a binary that has partial RELRO and NX stack protections
- main function repeatedly calls another function that acts as a fake terminal, allowing you to input several commands (e.g., `id`, `date`, `flag`, `hof`, etc.) and gives back predetermined responses
- additionally, `system` is present within the binary because `date` calls it
- there is an overflow in the `flag` option where it's willing to read 0x30 bytes into a buffer at rbp-0x10
- this allows us to gain control of the instruction pointer and redirect to `system`, but still need to load `/bin/sh` string somewhere
- the `hof` option reads in a name for the hall of fame and stores it in consistent address in the BSS
- can use this to load `/bin/sh` at a predictable location before using a `pop rdi` gadget along with the overflow to open a shell

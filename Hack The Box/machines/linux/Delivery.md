# Summary
- Takeaways:
	- immediately check web root directory for any credentials, especially if there is a mysql instance running on port 3306
	- use `hashid` for identifying hashes before finding the appropriate setting for `hashcat`
- User: gain access to internal company instant message platform by signing up with auto-generated email from support ticket system
- Root: crack the root hash from the MySQL database using `hashcat` rules

# Details
### User
- scan reveals port 22, 80, and 8065 open
- website reveals existence of `helpdesk.delivery.htb` as well as the company's internal instant message service on port 8065
- need a company email address to sign up for the internal instant message service, but given an auto-generated company email when you create a support ticket
- address is meant to be used to send updates or additional information regarding the support ticket, but the instant message confirmation email will also be visible in the support ticket communications
- internal company messaging platforms contains credentials to SSH in as well as a hint that `hashcat` rules will be used to crack a given password

### Root
- MySQL is running on port 3306 and enumerating web directory for the messaging service reveals credentials
- login in allows you to retrieve the root user password from the `users` database
- cracking it against `PleaseSubscribe!` from the internal chat message while using `hashcat` rules will reveal the password for `root`

#### Alternate routes:
- could also use `sucrack` along with the potential password list generated by `hashcast` rules in order to bruteforce the `root` password without pulling the hash from the SQL database
